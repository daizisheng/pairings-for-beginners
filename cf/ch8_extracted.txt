Chapter Eight
Series
8.1. Sequences. The basic definitions for complex sequences and series are essentially the
same as for the real case. A sequence of complex numbers is a function g : Z  C from

the positive integers into the complex numbers. It is traditional to use subscripts to indicate
the values of the function. Thus we write gn  z and an explicit name for the sequence
n
is seldomused; we write simply z  to stand for the sequence g which is such that
n
gn  z . For example,  i  is the sequence g for which gn  i .
n n n
The number L is a limit of the sequence z  if given an   0, there is an integer N such
n 
that |z  L|   for all n  N . If L is a limit of z , we sometimes say that z 
n  n n
converges to L. We frequently write limz   L. It is relatively easy to see that if the
n
complex sequence z   u  iv  converges to L, then the two real sequences u  and
n n n n
v  each have a limit: u  converges to ReL and v  converges to ImL. Conversely, if
n n n
the two real sequences u  and v  each have a limit, then so also does the complex
n n
sequence u  iv . All the usual nice properties of limits of sequences are thus true:
n n
limz  w   limz   limw ;
n n n n
limz w   limz limw ; and
n n n n
z limz 
lim n  n .
w
n limw 
n
provided that limz  and limw  exist. (And in the last equation, we must, of course,
n n
insist that limw   0.)
n
A necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of a sequence a  is the
n
celebrated Cauchy criterion: given   0, there is an integer N so that |a  a |  
 n m
whenever n,m  N .

A sequence f  of functions on a domain D is the obvious thing: a function fromthe
n
positive integers into the set of complex functions on D. Thus, for each zD, we have an
ordinary sequence f z. If each of the sequences f z converges, then we say the
n n
sequence of functions f  converges to the function f defined by fz  limf z. This
n n
pretty obvious stuff. The sequence f  is said to converge to f uniformly on a set S if
n
given an   0, there is an integer N so that |f z  fz|   for all n  N and all z  S.
 n 
Note that it is possible for a sequence of continuous functions to have a limit function that
is not continuous. This cannot happen if the convergence is uniform. To see this, suppose
the sequence f  of continuous functions converges uniformly to f on a domain D, let
n
z D,and let   0. We need to show there is a  so that |fz   fz|   whenever
0 0

|z  z|  . Let’s do it. First, choose N so that |f z  fz|   . We can do this because
0 N

of the uniformconvergence of the sequence f . Next, choose  so that
n
|f z   f z|   whenever |z  z|  . This is possible because f is continuous.
N 0 N 3 0 N
Now then, when |z  z|  , we have

0 N 0 N 0 N N
  
    ,

and we have done it!
Now suppose we have a sequence f  of continuous functions which converges uniformly
n
on a contour C to the function f. Then the sequence f zdz converges to fzdz. This
n
C C
is easy to see. Let   0. Now let N be so that |f z  fz|   for n  N, where A is the
n

length of C. Then,

n n
C C C

 A  
A
whenever n  N.
Now suppose f  is a sequence of functions each analytic on some region D, and suppose
n
the sequence converges uniformly on D to the function f. Then f is analytic. This result is in
marked contrast to what happens with real functions—examples of uniformly convergent
sequences of differentiable functions with a nondifferentiable limit abound in the real case.
To see that this uniformlimit is analytic, let z D, and let S  z : |z  z |  r  D . Now
0 0
consider any simple closed curve C  S. Each f is analytic, and so f zdz  0 for every
n n
C
n. Fromthe uniformconvergence of f  , we know that fzdz is the limit of the sequence
n
C
f zdz , and so fzdz  0. Morera’s theoremnow tells us that f is analytic on S, and
n
C C
hence at z . Truly a miracle.

8.2 Series. A series is simply a sequence s  in which s  a  a a . In other

words, there is sequence a  so that s  s  a . The s are usually called the partial

8.3 Power series. We are particularly interested in series of functions in which the partial

(We start with n  0 for esthetic reasons.) These are the so-called power series. Thus,
n
a power series is a series of functions of the form c z  z j .
j 0
j0
Let’s look first at a very special power series, the so-called Geometric series:
n
zj .
j0
Here
s  1  z  z2 zn, and
n
zs  z  z2  z3 zn1.
n
Subtracting the second of these fromthe first gives us
1  zs  1  zn1.
n
If z  1, then we can’t go any further with this, but I hope it’s clear that the series does not
have a limit in case z  1. Suppose now z  1. Then we have
1 zn1
s   .
n 1  z 1  z
Now if |z|  1, it should be clear that limzn1  0, and so
n
lim zj  lims  1 .
n 1  z
j0
Or,

zj  1 , for |z|  1.
1  z
j0
There is a bit more to the story. First, note that if |z|  1, then the Geometric series does
not have a limit (why?). Next, note that if |z|    1, then the Geometric series converges

uniformly to 1 . To see this, note that
1z
n
 j
j0
has a limit and appeal to the Weierstrass M-test.
Clearly a power series will have a limit for some values of z and perhaps not for others.
First, note that any power series has a limit whenz  z . Let’s see what else we can say.

Consider a power series c z  z j . Let
j 0
j0
  limsup j |c j | .
(Recall from6th grade that limsupa   limsupa : k  n.) Now let R  1 . (We
k k

shall say R  0 if   , and R   if   0. ) We are going to show that the series
converges uniformly for all |z  z |    R and diverges for all |z  z |  R.
0 0
First, let’s show the series does not converge for |z  z |  R. To begin, let k be so that
0
1 1
 k   .
|z  z | R

There are an infinite number of c j for which j |c j |  k, otherwise limsup j |c j |  k. For
each of these c we have
j
j
|c j z  z 0 j|  j |c j ||z  z 0 |  k|z  z 0 | j  1.
It is thus not possible for lim |c z  z n|  0, and so the series does not converge.
n 0
n
Next, we show that the series does converge uniformly for |z  z |    R. Let k be so
0
that
1 1
   k  .
R 
Now, for j large enough, we have j |c j |  k. Thus for |z  z 0 |  , we have

The geometric series kj converges because k  1 and the uniformconvergence

Consider the series  1 zj . Let’s compute R  1/limsup j |c j |  limsup j j!. Let

Thus n n!  K. Reflect on what we have just shown: given any number K, there is a
number n such that n n! is bigger than it. In other words, R  limsup j j!  , and so the
n
series  1 zj converges for all z.

Let’s summarize what we have. For any power series c z  z j , there is a number

limsup j|cj|
converge for |z  z |  R. (Note that we may have R  0 or R  .) The number R is
0
called the radius of convergence of the series, and the set |z  z |  R is called the circle
0
of convergence. Observe also that the limit of a power series is a function analytic inside
the circle of convergence (why?).
